# nwn-nwsync-docker
WIP: this will not work until beamdog images update.

## MAKE SURE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MODULE FILE IN "server/modules/"

nwnxee version will be put into urothis/nwnxee-template

# Usage
Spin up the docker compose, then run the bat script.

"docker-compose up" from root
"./nwnsnc.sh" should work on linux

Windows is not tested at all and wrong.
